# Policy Evidence and Institutional Analysis Documentation

**Research Framework:** Systematic documentation of institutional failures for policy development

## NHS England STOPSIM Coalition Evidence

### Official NHS England Position (2021)
**Source:** NHS England position on Serenity Integrated Mentoring (SIM) and similar models

**Key Policy Findings:**
- SIM and similar models **must no longer be used** in NHS mental health services
- **Police involvement in therapeutic interventions** explicitly prohibited
- **Sanctions, withholding care, and punitive approaches** classified as malpractice
- **Discriminatory practices** toward patients with self-harm behaviors forbidden

**STOPSIM Coalition Success Methodology:**
1. Systematic evidence gathering across multiple cases
2. Policy analysis showing violations of existing guidelines  
3. Lived experience testimony demonstrating human impact
4. Professional alliance building with reform-minded clinicians

## GMC Documentation: Dr Davidson Case

### Professional Standards Violations
**Evidence:** GMC investigation and professional criticism documented

**Systematic Pattern:**
- Poor clinical handover procedures
- Inadequate follow-up protocols
- Failure to maintain continuity of care
- Professional criticism from regulatory body

**Mathematical Framework Application:**
- b ≈ 0 trajectory analysis (complete dismissal pattern)
- Fixed point convergence to "no further action"
- Institutional sink behavior documented

## Thyroid Parameter Control Analysis

### Medical Evidence
**Clinical Pattern:** Medication adjustments 125μg → 100μg → 125μg → 112.5μg levothyroxine

**Mathematical Modeling:**
- Thyroid levels function as control parameter 'a' in dynamical systems
- System operates at reduced capacity during parameter adjustment
- Small changes create large behavioral effects (sensitive dependence)

**Institutional Accommodation Failures:**
- No recognition of circadian cycle requirements
- Failure to provide reasonable adjustments under Equality Act 2010
- Systematic discrimination against Non-24 sleep-wake disorder

## Policy Development Framework

### Edinburgh Engagement Strategy
**Objective:** Transform systematic documentation into policy recommendations

**Methodology:**
- Mathematical analysis of institutional behavior patterns
- Professional researcher positioning (not patient advocacy)
- Academic credentials establish authority for policy engagement
- Systematic approach following STOPSIM coalition model

### Legal Framework Integration
- **Equality Act 2010:** Reasonable adjustments for circadian disorders
- **Human Rights Act 1998:** Articles 3 and 8 protections
- **NHS Constitution:** Patient rights and professional standards

## Research Positioning

**Professional Identity:** Citizen scientist developing mathematical frameworks for institutional improvement

**Academic Authority:** M337 (100%), MST326, MS327 mathematical credentials

**Research Innovation:** First systematic application of fluid mechanics and dynamical systems to institutional analysis

**Policy Applications:** Quantitative tools for institutional design and optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Edinburgh policy network engagement**
2. **Academic paper development** for peer review
3. **Conference presentation** of research findings
4. **Policy recommendations** based on mathematical analysis

**Status:** Research phase complete. Policy development phase initiated.
