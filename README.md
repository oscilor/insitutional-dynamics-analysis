## Research Overview

This repository contains a novel mathematical framework for analyzing institutional behavior using advanced dynamical systems theory, fluid mechanics, and complex analysis. The work transforms institutional analysis from qualitative observation into quantitative engineering.

## Core Mathematical Framework

- **MS327 Dynamical Systems**: Three-stabilizer orbital framework, bifurcation analysis, chaos theory
- **MST326 Fluid Mechanics**: Institutional flow fields, Reynolds number analysis, critical transitions  
- **M337 Complex Analysis**: Conformal mapping, Mandelbrot parameter space, residue theory

## Key Models

1. **Orbital Evolution Model**: Time evolution of three-stabilizer system (study, physical, social)
2. **Fluid Dynamics Model**: Institutional flow fields with streamlines and critical points
3. **Complaints Trajectory Model**: a + bx linear map analysis of institutional responses

## Research Applications

- Circadian dynamics and institutional accommodation failures
- Mathematical modeling of bureaucratic discrimination  
- Systematic documentation of institutional response patterns
- Policy framework development for vulnerable person protections

## Methodology

Rigorous mathematical framework combining:
- Complex systems analysis using graduate-level mathematics
- Systematic data collection and reproducible methodology  
- Evidence-based policy recommendations
- Professional academic presentation standards

## Academic Credentials

- M337 Complex Analysis: 100% achievement (exceptional work recognition)
- MST326 Fluid Mechanics: Distinction-level performance
- MS327 Dynamical Systems: Advanced mathematical competency
- Citizen Science: Caithness tradition (Robert Dick, D'Arcy Thompson)

## Professional Positioning

This work represents a paradigm shift from "patient complaints" to "systematic institutional analysis" using mathematical authority established through consistent distinction-level performance across advanced mathematics modules.
